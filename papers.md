### **1. Problem-Solving in Python Programming**  

Problem-solving in Python refers to the **systematic approach** of identifying a problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, and using Python programming concepts to develop a solution. It involves **logical thinking, algorithm design, and efficient coding**.  

### **Stages of Problem-Solving in Python (with Example)**  
Let's solve a **real-world problem** using the **problem-solving stages**:  

#### **Problem Statement:**  
*"Given a list of numbers, find and print the largest number."*  

#### **Stages of Problem-Solving:**  

1. **Understanding the Problem:**  
   - We are given a list of numbers.  
   - We need to identify the **largest** number from the list.  
   - We should return or print the largest number.  

2. **Analyzing the Inputs and Outputs:**  
   - **Input:** A list of numbers (e.g., `[10, 25, 36, 89, 45]`).  
   - **Output:** The largest number (e.g., `89`).  

3. **Devising a Plan (Algorithm Design):**  
   - Initialize a variable `max_num` with the first number in the list.  
   - Iterate through the list and compare each number with `max_num`.  
   - If a number is greater than `max_num`, update `max_num`.  
   - After the loop, `max_num` will store the largest number.  

4. **Implementing the Solution in Python:**  
   - Writing Python code based on the designed algorithm.  

5. **Testing the Solution:**  
   - Checking with multiple test cases (e.g., lists with negative numbers, duplicate values, single-element lists).  

6. **Optimization (if needed):**  
   - Using Pythonâ€™s built-in `max()` function instead of manual comparison for better efficiency.
