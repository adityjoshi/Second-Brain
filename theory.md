### **1. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter**  

| Feature       | Compiler | Interpreter |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Execution | Translates the entire code at once before execution | Translates and executes code line by line |
| Speed | Faster since it executes after full translation | Slower as it processes line by line |
| Error Handling | Detects all errors at once after compilation | Detects errors one by one while executing |
| Output | Generates a separate executable file | Does not create a separate executable file |
| Examples | C, C++ (GCC, Clang) | Python, JavaScript (CPython, Node.js) |

### **2. Difference between Machine Level and Assembly Level Language**  

| Feature | Machine Level Language | Assembly Level Language |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Definition | Low-level language consisting of binary code (0s and 1s) | Low-level language that uses mnemonics (symbols) instead of binary code |
| Readability | Hard to understand and debug | Easier than machine code but still complex |
| Execution Speed | Very fast since it's directly understood by the processor | Slightly slower than machine code but still fast |
| Portability | Not portable, specific to each processor | Less portable, but easier to modify than machine code |
| Example | `10110100 00000011` | `MOV AL, 03H` |

### **3. Difference between Low-Level and High-Level Language**  

| Feature | Low-Level Language | High-Level Language |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Definition | Close to hardware, uses binary or mnemonics | Close to human language, uses keywords and syntax |
| Readability | Difficult to read and write | Easy to read and write |
| Portability | Not portable, hardware-dependent | Portable across different systems |
| Execution Speed | Faster execution | Slower due to compilation or interpretation |
| Example | Assembly, Machine Language | Python, Java, C, C++ |

### **4. Advantages and Disadvantages**  

#### **Machine Level Language**  
- **Advantages**  
  - Fast execution as it is directly understood by the CPU  
  - No need for translation, reducing processing overhead  

- **Disadvantages**  
  - Hard to understand and debug  
  - Highly hardware-dependent (not portable)  
  - Complex to write and maintain  

#### **Assembly Level Language**  
- **Advantages**  
  - Easier to understand than machine code (uses mnemonics)  
  - Provides more control over hardware and performance  
  - Faster execution compared to high-level languages  

- **Disadvantages**  
  - Still complex and requires knowledge of computer architecture  
  - Less portable, as it is hardware-dependent  
  - Needs an assembler to convert into machine code  

#### **High-Level Language**  
- **Advantages**  
  - Easy to learn, write, and debug  
  - Portable across different hardware platforms  
  - Increases programmer productivity  

- **Disadvantages**  
  - Slower execution compared to low-level languages  
  - Requires compilers or interpreters  
  - Less control over hardware resources

### **5. Difference between Verification and Validation**  

| Feature | Verification | Validation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Definition | Ensures the software meets design specifications | Ensures the software meets user requirements |
| Approach | Static testing (reviews, inspections) | Dynamic testing (actual execution) |
| Purpose | Checks "Are we building the product right?" | Checks "Are we building the right product?" |
| Example | Code reviews, walkthroughs, static analysis | Functional testing, user acceptance testing |

### **6. Difference between Time and Space Complexity**  

| Feature | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Definition | Measures the number of operations an algorithm takes as input size grows | Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as input size grows |
| Measurement | Usually represented as Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n)) | Also represented as Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(1)) |
| Focus | Speed of execution | Memory usage |
| Example | Sorting an array using QuickSort (O(n log n)) | Storing extra arrays in recursion (O(n)) |
