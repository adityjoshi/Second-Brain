### **1. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter**  

| Feature       | Compiler | Interpreter |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Execution | Translates the entire code at once before execution | Translates and executes code line by line |
| Speed | Faster since it executes after full translation | Slower as it processes line by line |
| Error Handling | Detects all errors at once after compilation | Detects errors one by one while executing |
| Output | Generates a separate executable file | Does not create a separate executable file |
| Examples | C, C++ (GCC, Clang) | Python, JavaScript (CPython, Node.js) |

### **2. Difference between Machine Level and Assembly Level Language**  

| Feature | Machine Level Language | Assembly Level Language |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Definition | Low-level language consisting of binary code (0s and 1s) | Low-level language that uses mnemonics (symbols) instead of binary code |
| Readability | Hard to understand and debug | Easier than machine code but still complex |
| Execution Speed | Very fast since it's directly understood by the processor | Slightly slower than machine code but still fast |
| Portability | Not portable, specific to each processor | Less portable, but easier to modify than machine code |
| Example | `10110100 00000011` | `MOV AL, 03H` |

### **3. Difference between Low-Level and High-Level Language**  

| Feature | Low-Level Language | High-Level Language |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Definition | Close to hardware, uses binary or mnemonics | Close to human language, uses keywords and syntax |
| Readability | Difficult to read and write | Easy to read and write |
| Portability | Not portable, hardware-dependent | Portable across different systems |
| Execution Speed | Faster execution | Slower due to compilation or interpretation |
| Example | Assembly, Machine Language | Python, Java, C, C++ |

### **4. Advantages and Disadvantages**  

#### **Machine Level Language**  
- **Advantages**  
  - Fast execution as it is directly understood by the CPU  
  - No need for translation, reducing processing overhead  

- **Disadvantages**  
  - Hard to understand and debug  
  - Highly hardware-dependent (not portable)  
  - Complex to write and maintain  

#### **Assembly Level Language**  
- **Advantages**  
  - Easier to understand than machine code (uses mnemonics)  
  - Provides more control over hardware and performance  
  - Faster execution compared to high-level languages  

- **Disadvantages**  
  - Still complex and requires knowledge of computer architecture  
  - Less portable, as it is hardware-dependent  
  - Needs an assembler to convert into machine code  

#### **High-Level Language**  
- **Advantages**  
  - Easy to learn, write, and debug  
  - Portable across different hardware platforms  
  - Increases programmer productivity  

- **Disadvantages**  
  - Slower execution compared to low-level languages

### **5. Difference between Verification and Validation**  

| Feature | Verification | Validation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Definition | Ensures the software meets design specifications | Ensures the software meets user requirements |
| Approach | Static testing (reviews, inspections) | Dynamic testing (actual execution) |
| Purpose | Checks "Are we building the product right?" | Checks "Are we building the right product?" |
| Example | Code reviews, walkthroughs, static analysis | Functional testing, user acceptance testing |

### **6. Difference between Time and Space Complexity**  

| Feature | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Definition | Measures the number of operations an algorithm takes as input size grows | Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as input size grows |
| Measurement | Usually represented as Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n)) | Also represented as Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(1)) |
| Focus | Speed of execution | Memory usage |
| Example | Sorting an array using QuickSort (O(n log n)) | Storing extra arrays in recursion (O(n)) |

### **Operator Precedence in Python**  

**Operator precedence** determines the order in which different operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with **higher precedence** are executed **before** those with lower precedence.  

### **Importance of Operator Precedence**  
- Ensures **correct evaluation** of expressions.  
- Helps avoid ambiguity in complex expressions.  
- Allows programmers to write **concise** code without excessive parentheses.  

### **Operator Precedence Order (Highest to Lowest)**  
1. **Parentheses `()`** – Ensures explicit grouping and has the highest precedence.  
2. **Exponentiation `**`** – Evaluates power operations before other arithmetic.  
3. **Unary operators `+`, `-`, `~`** – Applied before multiplication or division.  
4. **Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Floor Division `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`** – Evaluated before addition or subtraction.  
5. **Addition and Subtraction `+`, `-`** – Lower precedence than multiplication or division.  
6. **Bitwise shift `<<`, `>>`** – Shifts bits left or right.  
7. **Bitwise AND `&`** – Applied before XOR or OR operations.  
8. **Bitwise XOR `^`** – Evaluated before Bitwise OR.  
9. **Bitwise OR `|`** – Evaluated before comparison operators.  
10. **Comparison Operators `<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=`** – Evaluated before logical operators.  
11. **Logical NOT `not`** – Evaluated before `and` or `or`.  
12. **Logical AND `and`** – Evaluated before `or`.  
13. **Logical OR `or`** – Lowest precedence.  

### **Impact of Operator Precedence**  
- **Without parentheses**, higher precedence operators execute first.  
- **Parentheses `()` override** default precedence to force specific execution order.  
- **Logical operators follow a precedence hierarchy**, affecting boolean expressions.  

### **Importance of Operator Precedence in Python**  

1. **Ensures Correct Order of Execution:**  
   - Prevents misinterpretation of expressions by following a predefined evaluation order.  

2. **Reduces the Need for Extra Parentheses:**  
   - Helps write cleaner and more concise code by relying on precedence rules.  

3. **Improves Code Readability and Maintainability:**  
   - Developers can quickly understand how an expression is evaluated without additional grouping.  

4. **Prevents Logical and Mathematical Errors:**  
   - Avoids unintended results, especially in complex calculations and boolean expressions.  

5. **Optimizes Performance:**  
   - Python executes operations in an efficient sequence, reducing redundant computations.  

6. **Ensures Consistency Across Programs:**  
   - Precedence rules remain the same across different programs, making code behavior predictable.
